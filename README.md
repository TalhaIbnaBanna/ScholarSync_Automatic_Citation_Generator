# ScholarSync - Automatic Citation Generator

A citation generator which can handle multiple input types and prepare a perfectly formatted bibliography.

**The folder has 3 important files**

* The citation_generator.ipynb file: This is here I executed the ideation phase and built the entire infrastructure for my final website. I have added detailed markdowns here to explain how everything works. For anyone trying to understand how the code works, I recommend going through this first. This served as the foundation for the app.py file.
* The app.py file: This is the .py file used to host the website and it was built based on the citation_generator.ipynb file.
* The requirements.txt file: This was a file needed to host the website.
